Why Rayyan? 

We aren’t just another mining services company — we’re a growth engine for future-critical resources, built on science, trust, and a deep understanding of the land and its potential. 

1. Strategically Positioned 
Our work is rooted in the Arabian Shield — one of the world’s last great mineral frontiers. With active licenses and strong JV access, we’re unlocking gold, base metals, and critical minerals in one of the most promising yet underexplored terrains globally. 

2. Technical Excellence 
Our multidisciplinary team applies advanced geological, geophysical, and drilling methods, backed by NI 43-101 and JORC-compliant standards, supported by international specialists from Canada, Sudan, France, and more. 

3. Trusted by Leaders 
From national mining companies to ambitious juniors, Rayyan is the partner of choice. We deliver results with transparency, thorough technical insight, and a strong reputation earned through execution.  

4. Full-Cycle Services 
No need to coordinate between different vendors. Rayyan offers it all under one roof: mapping, sampling, geophysics, drilling, modeling, resource estimation, and JV planning. We make it easier for our clients to move faster and smarter through every phase. 

5. Built for Long-Term Value 
Our focus isn’t just hitting the next milestone. We help our clients grow the long-term value of their projects through proprietary data, repeatable systems, and credibility with investors.  

6. People & Responsibility 
Behind every survey and drill rig is a team that cares. We combine local knowledge with global standards, ensuring community respect, environmental awareness, and a shared vision for responsible growth.
