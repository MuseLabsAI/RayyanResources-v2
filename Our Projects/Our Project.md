Our Projects  
 

Umm Hadid Project (Ag-Pb-Zn) 

Owner: Silver Mining Company (SMC) 

 

Status: Active 

 

Located in the southern Afif Terrane, this project targets a historic resource of approximately 500,000 tonnes at 343 g/t silver. Mineralization is hosted in polymetallic quartz–carbonate veins associated with major shear zones. 

 

Geological & structural mapping (34 traverses) 

Rock sampling and mineralization tracing 

Ground magnetic & IP surveys 

Diamond drilling program 

OTV Survey 

Core Logging 

 

Objective: Position Umm Hadid as a JV-ready, drill-stage silver-lead-zinc asset with compelling economics. 

 

Kenz Global JV Projects 

Structure: Rayyan–Kenz Strategic JV  
Status: Onboarding 

This strategic JV covers 9 license areas across the Afif, Nuqrah, and Zalim belts, targeting Gold, Copper, and Silver. Rayyan serves as the exclusive exploration partner. 

Right of first refusal (ROF) agreements 

Data compilation and target generation 

JV structuring for investor readiness 

Objective: Aggregate 9 high-potential licenses into a single valuation stack targeting TSX or Nomu capital markets. 

 

 

Alkhadarah Prospect Project (Au) 

Owner: Kenz Global Resources 

 

Status: Phase 1 Completed 

 

A grassroots gold prospect located in the Afif region of the Arabian Shield. The project focuses on identifying mineralization within shear zones and at the contact between metavolcanics and intrusive granites. 

 

Geological & remote sensing mapping 

Systematic trenching and channel sampling 

Geochemical analysis and interpretation 

Prospect evaluation reporting 

 

Objective: Conduct a systematic, first-pass evaluation to identify priority zones and provide clear recommendations for the next phase of exploration. 

 

Exploration Program in Riyadh Province (Au, Ag, Cu, Ni) 

Owner: Marzuk Bin Musallam Al-Mahmadi Equipment Rental Co. 

 

Status: Phase 1 Completed, Active Phase 2 

 

A large 99.4 km² license in the Riyadh Region with potential for structurally controlled precious and base metal deposits. The program targets major N-S trending shear zones and prospective geological contacts. 

 

Detailed geological mapping (1:5,000 scale) 

Targeted rock chip & channel sampling  

Digital data capture with QGIS/QField 

Implementation of JORC-compliant QA/QC protocols 

 

Objective: Systematically explore the license area to generate and prioritize high-quality targets for future drilling campaigns.
